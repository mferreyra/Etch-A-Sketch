# Etch-A-Sketch
The Odin Project (Project: Etch-A-Sketch)

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. 
You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
This project should not be easy for you.
